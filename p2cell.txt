There are two main method provided in the p2num.py,

one is to map a two-number or three-number tuple into one single number

the other is same mapping method but with a proportional shift.


1,  hash any number into integer by dividing w, h, l which corresponding to

    the first, second or third number.

    if hash with some shift, then prior to dividing, first the number will
    be minused by shift*w, shift*h or shift*l.

2,  after hashing, then the new tuple will be paired into one single number
    by pairing function which one-on-one function.

3,  Any set points with two or three coordinates now are represented by a one
    single number, then any set of points could be represented by a vector
    of integer values.

4,  A set of points can now be minhashed into signature which used to
    approximate the jaccard similarity between them.
